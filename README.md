# QA-Automation

# Project Description
"This is a web UI automation framework built with Selenium and API testing framework built with Rest Assured to simplify and streamline the process of testing web applications. The framework includes a range of features, such as automated test scripts with boundary tests, positive tests, and negative tests support for many browsers that integrates with popular test management tools."

## Getting Started
"To get started, clone the repository to your local machine and install the required dependencies in maven repository. You will also need to have Java installed to use the Selenium WebDriver and Rest Assured libraries."

## Usage
"To create a new UI test script, simply create a new file in the 'test/ui' directory and use the provided syntax to define your test cases. You can then run the test using the command '`gradlew cucumber -Ptags=”@web"'. To create a new API test script, create a new file in the 'test/api' directory and use the provided syntax to define your test cases. You can then run the test using the command '`gradlew cucumber -Ptags=”@api"'."
